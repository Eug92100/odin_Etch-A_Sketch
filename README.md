From the Odin's project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

<p> In this project, you have to create a grid whose number of cells in it would update depending on a user input. To do so it's necessary to create a button that deletes the current grid and asks the user to give a number. It will then create the new grid.  </p>
